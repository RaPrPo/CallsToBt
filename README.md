## Disclaimer

I am no way associated with RsNav. I am only a user of the RsNav Head Unit in my car. I have developed this app for my personal use and making it open source for the benefit of the community. 

App do not read/store/send any of the contact details. It just forwards the phone number to the RsNav Bluetooth service. Use it at your own risk.
